## Purpose and Goals

In a general sense, the purpose of paper is to create a quantitative framework, a model, to explore the relationship between bioturbation, erosion, and particle size distribution and their collective impact on soil profile and landscape development, across organisms.

To this end, there are three broad goals:

1.  Complete a review of bioturbation rates, frequency, and depth-dependence across organisms.
2.  Complete a review of the current bioturbation modeling landscape.
3.  Construct a model that integrates bioturbation, erosion, and particle size distribution on soil-profile and landscape scales.

## Goal 1: Bioturbation across organisms

## Goal 2: Bioturbation Modeling Landscape

There are a number of bioturbation models already present in the literature

## Goal 3: Modeling Building

### Qualitative goals

To create a simple model with a limited number of input parameters that can…

1.  Describe stoneline development and clay homogenization [two of the most important texture parameters] [does advection need to be included for clay?]
2.  Describe the relationship between erosion rate and stoneline depth.
3.  Describe erosion and deposition as it relates to particle size [to adjust for the preferential erosion of fines] and explain the contribution to streams.
4.  Accommodate changes in erosion rates at discrete time steps [e.g. to simulate the impact of an invasive species or landscape change] or in the introduction of bioturbators.
5.  Represent a suite of bioturbators with unique particle size preferences [only one per model run though] and mixing rates.
