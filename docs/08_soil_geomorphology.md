Dissertation using landlab, could be interesting to check out:

Mahmoudi, M. (2018). **Comparing model predictions of hillslope sediment size distribution with field measurements** (Doctoral dissertation, San Francisco State University).

Ideas:

-   Use landlab to simulate hillslope evolution under different earthworms / bioturbation types? Broaden to landscape scale? Include sediment contribution to streams?

-   Simulate Mima mound creation by pocket gophers using a landlab module?
