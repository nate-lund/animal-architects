## Data Management Standards

*Metadata*. Metadata will be generated to describe all data in a .txt format and will be stored alongside the data for each survey. Metadata will describe contributors, site characteristics, survey conditions, naming conventions, collection methods and devices, and analyses performed.

File naming convention is as follow: YYYYMMDD-method_siteID_number_initials_dataORmetadata

For example: 20250520_TLS_MAG_01_NL_data, for data collected on 2025-05-04 using the terrestrial laser scanner at Magnolia forest collected by Nate Lund.
