Gabet et al. (2003)

introduces a quantitative model for understanding sediment transport by tree throw. Gabet (2000) uses a similar approach to model hillslope morphology in gopher-activity dominated systems. The author suggests a new equation for hillslope evolution based on hillslope gradient:

$$
q_s(\frac{cm^3}{cm*a})=176(\frac{dz}{dx})^3-189(\frac{dz}{dz})^2+68(\frac{dz}{dx})
$$

The following equation represents a general framework for how bioturbators move soil (qs sediment flux) on a hillslope:

$$
q_s = \frac{vol}{event} * \frac{distance}{event} * \frac{events}{area} * \frac{events}{time}
$$

The authors in Gabet et al. (2003) also provide an overview of the role several bioturbators play in soil development and formation (physical disturbance of saprolie).

provide a novel framework for soil evolution: one that describe soil as a function of progressive and regressive pedogensis. Progressive pedogensis includes horizonation processes, developmental up-building, and soil deepening. Regressive pedogensis includes haploidization processes, retardant up-building, and soil removal. Development up-building, versus retardant up-building, requires added material be pedogenetically assimilated into the profile. Often this depends on the rate of addition. The authors suggest positive and negative vectors for the following that together drive or oppose soil development:

> Horizonation ( + ) \<------------\> Haploidization ( - )

Evolution vectors:

1.  Removals (from one or more horizons) ( + / - )

2.  Translocations ( + / - )

3.  Transformations ( + / - )

4.  Feedback processes ( + / - )

5.  Bioturbation ( + / - )

6.  Upbuilding ( + / - )

7.  Deepening ( + )

8.  Removals ( - )

The authors also introduce the idea of internal feedback processes endogenic soil properties dominate over exogenic, environmental factors. For example, a petrocalcic horizon may develop in soil with a Ca rich parent material under an arid climate. This petrocalcic horizon, a product of soil genesis, impacts future development though leaching or bioturbation. A threshold was crossed that put the soil down a unique pedogenetic pathway.

The authors also reference Jenny's 1941 clopt model and use that elegant framework to describe their approach of soil genesis. It is a reminder of the utility of that basic equation and it's many applications.

(Nye, 1954)

discusses the genesis of a catena of tropical soils in West Africa making reference to the role of soil fauna, here ants, earthworms, and termites, in the creation of stonelines in soils. The author compares the soil texture of termite mounds to that of the suspected termite-formed horizon and finds them similar. He makes notes about coarse fragment size relating to bedrock fracture density and the releative importance of clay illuviation in texture contrast development.

(Baxter et al., 2024)

details the evolution of European mole hills over time. Authors created a table of review data w/ mole hill evolution rates. Note about the importance of disturbance regime. Moles reconstruct collapsed burrows. If burrows are frequently collapsed (e.g. by floods or human disturbance), moles will anually excavate more sediment than those in stable landscapes. This poses a challenge for measurement, because we then need both mound abundance and disturbance regime.
