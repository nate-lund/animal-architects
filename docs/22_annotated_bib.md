-   Review on the global distrobution and conservation/endangered status of bioturbator mammals. Great map showing global abundance, mostly in subtropical and temperate grasslands. 22% of non-flying land-dwalling mammal species regularly perform bioturbation.
-   This data would be fascinating to look more into. Especially if there was invertebrate data to pair it with. As is, this is a good source for the widespread distribution of bioturbators, and shows that at least globally they are sensitive to moisture.
-   Present a table on with some examples of ecological roles. Could be useful.

-   A review of the activities of leaf cutter ants (LCA) in neoamerica. Create both constructional (surface) and excavational (subsurface) landforms that both have impact landscape evolution (e.g. filled burrows contribute to soil creep). They perform both biomixing AND biosorting simultaneously, depending on the parent material.

-   Actions on the landscape are cumulative. Hundreds of colonies over thousands of years. Some intentional constructions: mounds are built to reduce flooding of burrows.

-   Really great figure that represents the different sources of downward-moving material.

-   This is great evidence of cumulative impacts to support a conceptual model.

-   A very thorough review (1000+ sources) on the behaviors and impacts of bioturbators, vertebrates and invertebrates, in Chile. Acknowledges prior studes are heterogenious in methods, hard to estimate impact on the landscape and do not cover other biomes besides NA.

-   Covers variability in excavation rates, tunnel diameter (sorting implications?), burrow depth, geographic distribution. Touches on the need for seasonality.

-   This can be used for a lot. Great evidence for the variability and different axes of animal activity, and also highlights the need for more thorough, consistent data.
