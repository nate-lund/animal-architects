# Animals as Agents of Heterogeneity and Homogeneity in Soil and Landscape Development



## Purpose and Goals

In a general sense, the purpose of this chapter is to create a quantitative framework, a model, to explore the relationship between bioturbation, erosion, and particle size distribution and their collective impact on soil profile and landscape development, across organisms.

To this end, there are two broad goals:

1.  Complete a review of bioturbation rates, frequency, and depth-dependence across organisms.
2.  Complete a review of the current bioturbation modeling landscape.

## Goal 1: Bioturbation across organisms

## Goal 2: Bioturbation Modeling Landscape

### Model types

There are a number of bioturbation models already present in the literature
