## Purpose and Goals

In a general sense, the purpose of this chapter is twofold: to review the current state of the study and modeling of bioturbation and to create a small data set of bioturbators for model verification.

To this end, there are two broad goals:

1.  Complete a review of the current bioturbation modeling landscape to answer the questions:
    -   What are the different approaches to modeling bioturbation or how can the current models be classified?
    -   What are the limitations or what is the applicability of theses models? What is their purpose?
    -   What spatial and temporal scale do models operate on? Soil profile or landscape? Decade or millennium?
2.  Complete a review of bioturbation rates, frequency, depth-dependence, and particle size limitations across organisms for model verification and to answer the question:
    -   How do bioturbators create structure and variability across the landscape?

## Goal 1: Bioturbation Modeling Landscape

### Model types

There are a number of bioturbation models present in the literature. (Michel et al., 2022) provides a review of...

### Models

1.  Johnson et al. (2014)

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{d}{dz}(D(z)\frac{dy}{dz})
$$

or (with erosion factor T)

$$ \frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{d}{dz}(D(z)\frac{dy}{dz}) - T\frac{dA}{dz} $$

where

$$
D(z) = D(0)e^{-z/z_{b}}
$$

where

$$
T\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{y}{dz}\frac{\delta y}{\delta t}=\frac{dA}{dt})
$$

2.  Apples

$$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$
