# Bioturbation, in Review



The purpose of this section is to organize disparate notes on bioturbation and to create a small data set of bioturbators for model verification.

To this end, there are two broad goals:

1.  Complete a review of bioturbation rates, frequency, depth-dependence, and particle size limitations across organisms for model verification and to answer the question:
    -   How do bioturbators create structure and variability across the landscape?

## New Paths

-   Based on (Mudd and Yoo, 2010), a study on mineral age and weathering. Mixing plays an important role in the application of reservoir theory and in determining turnover time. A better understanding of the rate of mixing, depth of mixing, and method of transport (i.e. local vs non-local) migth be valuable.

-   How does the successional invasion of JW over European worms, through the displacement of Lumbricus terrestris, impact the type of mixing, I.e. local versus non local, and what are the consequences for clay movement in the soil?
