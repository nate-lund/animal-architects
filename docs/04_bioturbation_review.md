# Bioturbation Geo-Ecology



The central idea of this section and chapter as a whole is to assess the role of animals in soil and landscape development. Specifically, to collect evidence for the statement:

> Animals unintentionally create heterogeneity and homogeneity in soil and landscape development.

It begs the question, what kind of framework, whether qualitative or quantitative, can we create to broadly understand the role of organisms in soil and landscape development? This section focuses on the qualitative side, whereas the following modeling sections represent a quantitative approach.

Goals:

1.  Complete a review of bioturbation rates, frequency, depth-dependence, and particle size limitations across organisms for model verification.
2.  Qualitatively review the role of indivudal bioturbators as "unintentional architects" in landscape and soil development.
    -   How do bioturbators create structure and variability across the landscape?

## Bioturbators

Gabet et al. (2003) introduces a qualitative model for understanding sediment transport by tree throw. Gabet (2000) uses a similar approach to model hillslope morphology in gopher-activity dominated systems. The author suggests a new equation for hillslope evolution based on hillslope gradient:

$$
q_s(\frac{cm^3}{cm*a})=176(\frac{dz}{dx})^3-189(\frac{dz}{dz})^2+68(\frac{dz}{dx})
$$

The following equation represents a general framework for how bioturbators move soil (qs sediment flux) on a hillslope:

$$
q_s = \frac{vol}{event} * \frac{distance}{event} * \frac{events}{area} * \frac{events}{time}
$$

The authors in Gabet et al. (2003) also provide an overview of the role several bioturbators play in soil development and formation (physical disturbance of saprolie). References to pursue:

## Notes to Self

-   Based on (Mudd and Yoo, 2010), a study on mineral age and weathering. Mixing plays an important role in the application of reservoir theory and in determining turnover time. A better understanding of the rate of mixing, depth of mixing, and method of transport (i.e. local vs non-local) migth be valuable.

-   How does the successional invasion of JW over European worms, through the displacement of Lumbricus terrestris, impact the type of mixing, I.e. local versus non local, and what are the consequences for clay movement in the soil?
