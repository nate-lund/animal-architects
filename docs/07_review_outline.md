## Chapter Outline

-   Introduction

    -   Background: the significance and history of bioturbation to pedology

    -   Purpose

-   Conceptual "model"

    -   Explanation: how can we categorize what are animals doing to the soil?

    -   Examples from the literature

-   Numerical model

    -   Background: what models are out there?

    -   Methods

    -   Application

-   Conclusion

## Conceptual Model

Establish conceptual framework(s) for approaching the function of an organism in a soil genesis. Why?

-   As pedologists, we rely on conceptual models to describe the morphology and 'tell the story' of a soil.

-   It informs the methods we use to measure bioturbation.

-   It informs the questions we ask about a soil.

-   Before constructing a quantitative numerical model, we need to identify the processes that are relevant to our aim. Here, that aim is describing soil genesis, but it could be contaminant transport, carbon or nutrient cycling, erosion, etc.

$$
q_s = \frac{vol}{event} * \frac{distance}{event} * \frac{events}{area} * \frac{events}{time}
$$

We need to think about...

-   Spatial variability.

    -   What is the spatial distribution and frequency of these organisms' disturbance?

    -   How can that be related to organisms/area?

    -   How has this changed over time and what evidence is there?

    -   How is organism activity related to topography?

    -   How deeply do organisms impact the soil?

-   Local vs. non-local mixing

    -   How are organisms mixing the soil?

-   Mixing vs sorting

    -   What are organisms moving?

    -   What aren't they moving?
