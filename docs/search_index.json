"],["about-start-here.html", "Section 2 About (start here) 2.1 Table of Contents", " Section 2 About (start here) This book is dedicated to my thoughts about animals as unintentional architects, or animal architects. Through bioturbation, animals shape our soils and landscapes, but although I call them architects, their creations are not like ours. Yes, prairie gophers or night crawlers build homes to live and feed in, but the architecture I refer to is larger than any individual. It is the sum of generations of organisms. It is the ecological inheritance they create. It is order out of seemingly chaos. This idea is best illustrated through example, so take for example, Mima mounds. Mima mounds in Washington. National Geographic. Mima mounds are a somewhat common landscape feature in the Western United states, they are thought to be formed by pocket gophers. A study by Cox and Allen (1987) revealed that in these landscapes, even though it is less energetically favorable, gophers preferentially move soil uphill. The authors suggests that because these soils are often wet, mounding soil increases aeration, plant growth, and provides safer burrowing space (Cox and Allen, 1984). So yes, locally gophers are mounding soil. But the size of these mounds (sometimes several meters) are beyond what a single gopher can produce. It is thus across generations and across the landscape we see structure and order out of individual behavior. This book is organized loosely by my dissertation chapters. Chapter 1 is about invasive earthworms and their impact on soil erosion in Minnesota’s forests. It is practical research, and does/will include many field methods, data analysis, and experimental design thoughts. Soil science, ecology, and hydrology are important topics. Chapter 2 is about bioturbation in the literature: how it’s perceived, how it’s modeled, how it’s connected to soil and landscape formation. Much thought is given to the qualitative tools we use to describe and categorize bioturbation and bioturbators. Chapter 3 is about modeling and using the lessons and data from prior chapters to create a quantitative framework for biological processes that drive soil, landscape, and hillslope formation. 2.1 Table of Contents Animals as Agents of Heterogeneity and Homogeneity in Soil and Landscape Development Chapter 1: MITPPC, Earthworms, and Soil Erosion Manuscript: “soil erosion rates in jumping worm-infested vs. Lumbricus spp.-infested forested hillslopes based on short-lived isotopes and erosion pins.” - 2025 Manuscript: “soil erosion rates in jumping worm-infested vs. Lumbricus spp.-infested forested hillslopes based on field experiment.” - 2026 Manuscript: “Rainfall intensity and soil erosion in jumping worm-infested vs. Lumbricus spp.-infested forested hillslopes.” - 2026 Chapter 2: Literature Review of Animal Activity: Concepts, Methods, and Models Introduction, bioturbation history Conceptual models and methods Numerical models Chapter 3: Modeling Soil, Hillslope, Landscape Evolution Bioturbation model, with particle size (1D) Creep/mixing/production (2D lateral) Hillslope evolution (2D vertical) "],["hillslope-transects-erosion-pins-etc..html", "Section 3 Hillslope Transects: Erosion Pins, etc. 3.1 Fieldwork Timeline 2025", " Section 3 Hillslope Transects: Erosion Pins, etc. 3.1 Fieldwork Timeline 2025 Early Summer, April/May: Soil sampling for FRNs, bulk density, and soil texture Install sediment collectors Mid Summer, June/July/August Sample sediment collectors, biweekly Sample native plant trial sediment collectors, monthly Assess health of native plants Following leaf littler removal: Measure erosion pins, biweekly Take images of Wood Duck Trail vegetation "],["imapct-of-vegetation-cover-on-erosion.html", "Section 4 Imapct of Vegetation Cover on Erosion", " Section 4 Imapct of Vegetation Cover on Erosion "],["animal-architects-a-conceptual-model-for-geomorphic-and-pedological-animal-activity.html", "Section 5 Animal Architects: A Conceptual Model for Geomorphic and Pedological Animal Activity 5.1 Introduction 5.2 Conceptual models", " Section 5 Animal Architects: A Conceptual Model for Geomorphic and Pedological Animal Activity Very Tentative “Abstract” The subject of this review is: how do animals impact the physical evolution of soils and terrestrial landscapes? There is an abundance of literature on the roles of individual animals, in both case studies and reviews. I first propose a framework or conceptual model for classifying these behaviors. The model incorporates both lateral and vertical dimensions of animal activity. Vertically, animals either mix or layer soil. Laterally, animals create variety in surface structures and/or more broadly influence erosion processes. It also addresses the dual roles of animals in creating heterogeneity and homogeneity in terrestrial landscapes and soils. I next use the conceptual model to evaluate the emphases, successes, and limitations of current numerical modeling approaches. Advanced measurement techniques like optically stimulated luminescence, fallout radionuclide tracers, or image analysis, are increasingly applied to bioturbation research. These methods are often used to generate model parameters that provide generalized descriptions of bioturbation processes. There are several approaches to this model construction covered here, each of which with a unique emphasis and limitations. 5.1 Introduction Soil is the most complex system in the natural world. At a fundamental level, it encompasses biological, chemical, and physical sciences. At an earth-system level, it governs the planet’s atmosphere, ecosystems, and water cycle. And at a disciplinary level, it unites agronomists, ecologists, geomorphologists, and hydrologists. With so much breadth, our knowledge of soils is vast—which is fitting for the “most complex and unparsimonious of all natural science entities” (Johnson et al., 2005). However, this diversity of work, to be impact and organized, requires a central guiding principle. To understand where we are going, we need to look at where we’ve been. Pedology, the study of soil formation, was first defined by Friedrich Albert Fallou in his 1862 book “Pedology or General and Special Soil Science” (Fallou, 1862). Since then, pedology has been defined and refined by many authors, all circling Hans Jenny’s basic definition, “the section of the domain of soil science that studies the soil body in its natural position” (Jenny, 1941). It explains that soil is predicable; that its formation is governed by factors and processes that can be quantified. However, although pedology is so clearly defined, its singular subject remains hard to characterize, as the same soil profile, as is it today, could be the focus of manys -ists: agronomists, ecologists, soil geomorphologists, hydrologists, etc. Beyond that, soils change through time, so there are countless profiles with countless properties through countless time. The role of a pedologist is to simplify this immense amount of information it into a narrative, and any narrative needs structure. Pedologists, like all scientists, rely on simplified, conceptual models to understand their system. The most influential, although not the first (citation), is Jenny’s clorpt model, where soil is defined as a function of climate, organisms, relief, parent material, and time (Jenny, 1941). The cloprt model provides a framework for thinking about soils and situates soils in their broader environment. It also allows for connections to be drawn between hydrology (climate), geomorphology (relief), geology (parent material), and ecology (organisms). There are two lessons we can learn from this: 1) conceptual models are invaluable to understanding the natural world, and 2) animals are important. Animals have long been recognized to play an important role in the history of our soils and landscapes. Charles Darwin was the first to recognize the influence of animals, earthworms, in the development of soil morphology (Darwin, 1881), and although organisms were once underrepresented in pedological discourse (Johnson &amp; Schaetzl, 2015), their prevalence has substantially increased in recent years. Soil or soil-adjacent scientists use many terms to describe the role living organisms play in a soil system. Broadly pedoturbation, bioturbation, fauna- and floraturbation, or biomixing (Wilkenson et al., 2009), or more specifically mounding, cratering, or burrowing (Johnson et al., 2005a), to name a few. For this discussion, I use a generalized term: animal activity. Animal activity has the advantage of being implicitly process-based, i.e. animal activities are distinct from the evidence of animal activities. It also encourages thinking about the animals themselves and their relationships to each other and their environment. And finally, it suggests a degree of unintentionality. Animals, oftentimes including humans, don’t understand soils or soil science. All the evidences we study are the unintentional consequences of their lifestyles, often over generations. Thus, the product of animal activities are a refecltion of their ecological characters rather. There exist already a number of excellent reviews on the various roles and categorizations’ of animal activity in soils (Bétard, 2021; Gabet et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2005b, 2005a; Johnson &amp; Watson-Stegner, 1987; Wilkinson et al., 2009). So, although there is overlap, this paper’s emphasis is on the quantification of these categories and how they can be integrated in a holistic, qualitative framework for describing soil fauna activities. The overarching goal of this paper is to take a first, albeit small, step towards a standardized understanding of how and why animal activity is measured that can be applied across the discipline of soil science… To that end, I begin with a discussion of the types of relevant animal behaviors and how they can be categorized. 5.2 Conceptual models Animal behaviors and classifications Animals are extremely diverse in their individual behaviors, and species ecology drives their role on the landscape. Ants, termites, gophers, and earthworms, among others, each occupy unique roles, niches, that translate to unique changes in soils and landscapes. Here, I consider any behavior that translocates soil, either vertically or laterally, across a terrestrial environment. There exists substantial inter-species difference as well–exemplified in the ecological classifications of earthworms discussed later. Throughout this cross- and inter-species variability, there are a two trends–or axes–that arise. One, animals, introduce diversity on lateral and vertical scales. And two, animals create unique impacts across timescales (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Visualization of the categories of animal activity. Animals work vertically. Vertical mixing of the soil is perhaps the most high-profile impact of soil dwelling animals. Earthworm species may be epigeic (litter dwellers), endogeic (soil dwellers), and anecic (burrowing surface feeders), or some combination of the three (Hale et al., 2005). Animals work laterally. Animals introduce heterogeneity. Animals introduce order. Table 1. Gallery of some animal behaviors and the categories they belong to. Case Studies of Animal Activity The precise behaviors of animals is the subjects of entire disciplines. However, their importance to pedology, geomorphology, and agronomy is increasingly recognized. Organism have been recognized as important factors pedogenetic factors since the time of the first pedologists. Darwin recognized the role of earthworms in hillslope formation, soil horizination, the burial of large coarse fragments, and the darkening of upper soil horizons (Darwin, 1881). Hans Jenny included organisms in the original clorpt model in 1941 Factors. Countless studies provide examples…. Using the framework established above (Figure 1), the animals of each study can be plotted on a quadrant. Figure 2. Quadrant plot of animals with examples Geomorphology… Agronomy, soil health… 6.2 Numerical Models Conceptual models alone are valuable for describing a number of processes, as justified above. However, quantitative, numerical models are a more powerful tool for answering questions and making predictions, and can inform and be informed by conceptual ones… Numerical models are now being used across for many soils-applications. [connect this back to the list of important subjects established in the introduction: ecology, weathering, carbon, etc.] [These should be somewhat outside of the models discussed here, althought still relating to pedology in some regard to demonstrate the value more modeling can bring. for example: (Vanwalleghem et al., 2013), (Salvador-Blanes et al., 2007)] Likewise, modeling the activity of soil fauna is increasing. Modeling soil fauna also bridges both sub-aqueous and sub-aerial soils. Greater emphasis was given to the numerical modeling of sub-aqueous soil turbation through feeding, burrowing, and burial than sub-aerial soils throughout the 20th century (Michel et al., 2022). However, as increasing attention is payed to the role of soil organisms in pedological studies, a more substantial body of work is emerging [this connects to the introduction]…. Before individual works and models are discussed, however, its is important to establish the braod-stokes and approaches of these models. Then, an analysis of specfic models will allow us to identify the key parameters and draw comparisons to the conceptual models above. Characteristics of Numerical Models Anomalous and Normal mixing There are two broad approaches to modeling bioturbation in terrestrial and aquatic environments: anomalous mixing and normal mixing. Anomalous mixing models simulate the trajectory of individual sediment particles by capturing their discontinuous movement in “jumps” between periods of waiting (Michel et al., 2022). Jump length and waiting time, both organism-specific stochastic variables, are modeled to simulate mixing over short periods of time (Meysman et al., 2010 in Michel et al., 2022). Normal mixing is analogous with the diffusion process and is described by a diffusion-advection equation. Of interest to this review, if simulation time and jump counts are sufficiently large, anomalous mixing models coincide with the diffusive model (Michel et al., 2022) [further reading needed]. Further, the mathematics overlap, and the biodiffusion coefficient can be described as… [a function of jump length]. As soil development occurs over relativity long periods is the focus of this review, normal mixing is the primary approach explored here. [Sources to further look into] Meysman 2008: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2008.04.023 Meysman 2010: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230736816_When_and_why_does_bioturbation_lead_to_diffusive_mixing Marie 2007: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2006.10.052 Local diffusion and Non-local mixing Normal mixing is further described as the sum of two components: local and non-local mixing, each of which can be modeled. To illustrate the difference, imagine burying a marble at the bottom of a bucket of sand. To get the marble out, you have two options. Digging sand out and piling it up on the side is comparable to non-local mixing. Forcing your hand through the loosely packed sand, displacing it as you go, is similar to local mixing. Formally, local mixing is the random displacement of material across distances over which the change in soil composition is minimal (Boudreau, 1986a). Because translocation distance is small and randomly determined, local mixing is approximately described by a diffusion-advection equation. Correspondingly, when soil is mixed, soil components will move diffusely across concentration gradients. Local mixing is common for most bioturbators and includes ingestion/egestion, pushing/shouldering of particles, and local digging/foraging… [citation to break these down]. Epi-, endo-, and epiendogeic earthworm species are all local mixers. More examples… Non-local mixing represents the displacement of material in which the point of excavation is far from the point of deposition. Its characterized by translocation of excavated material to the soil surface followed by infilling from local material [???]. [Boudreau (1986a) suggests non-local mixing cannot be defined by diffusion. Keep reading.] Non-local mixing is common for mound building and burrowing organisms like Anecic earthworm species and pocket gophers. Both local and non-local mixing represent a substantial movement of material but differ in scale. Local mixing acts on a horizon to horizon scale. Non-local mixing acts on a profile scale. Given enough time and stability, either may completely ‘turn over’ the profile. Jarvis et al. (2010) found that models excluding non-local mixing significantly underestimate surface burial. Matisoff et al. (2011) also integrate a non-local mixing factor into their model. Depth dependence Most bioturbation models consider the observation made by scientists as far back as Charles Darwin that organism activity declines with depth (Darwin, 1881), with more contemporary authors attempting to quantify this decline (Vanwalleghem et al., 2013; among others). However, a degree of nuance is needed to understand when this observation is relevant to modeling. Depth dependence is relevant under the following conditions. 1) Organism activity does not encompass the entire profile. 2) The system is not in equilibrium, or too little time has passed for bioturbation to homogenize the soil profile. 3) The rate of mixing is large compared to soil erosion or production. 4) Material that is introduced to the profile decays, weathers, or is otherwise transformed at a rate neither too fast to be meaningfully redistributed by fauna nor to slow to reach equilibrium. If one or multiple of these conditions are met, a diffusion-depth function is needed. [are examples needed to illustrate this?] Boudreau (1986a) provides equations for when these conditions are met for specific radioisotopes. When depth dependence is relevant, a function that describes the diffusion-depth relationship is derived. A diffusion-depth function requires three pieces of information: surface diffusion coefficient, maximum bioturbation depth, and the shape of the decline. There is a general consensus in the literature that the function’s shape is best described by an exponential function (Boudreau, 1986a; Jarvis et al. 2010; Román‐Sánchez et al., 2019; Kirkby, 1985). The remaining two parameters are the most influential parameters in diffusion models (Román‐Sánchez et al., 2019). They are determined through field observation, as suggested by Boudreau (1986a), or by fitting an equation to the vertical distributions of radioisotope tracers (Gray et al., 2020; Jarvis et al. 2010; Matisoff et al., 2011), for shorter timescales, or OSL-determined quartz grain ages, for longer timescales (Johnson et al. 2014; Román‐Sánchez et al., 2019). [erosion is also kinda important to this relationship, but not as. Discuss how erosion is measured, briefly] Attempts to broaden model application are challenged by the considerable variability in theses parameters across environments [Table X] and the relative costs of radioisotope tracer or OSL analysis. However, there may be future opportunities to estimate parameters. As discussed in the conceptual model section, holistically considering the impact of soil fauna on mixing may provide insights into alternative methods. Kirkby (1985) suggests the possibility of using a bulk density profile to estimate mixing intensity. Estimating animal or disturbance density may also play an important role. Review of equations from the literature Because determining the animal activity-depth ratio is critical to diffusive models, it is practical to break down the various modeling approaches by the method used to determine this relationship. Currently, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and isotope tracers are the most promising techniques. Quick note on time step size, discussed further later. Since these are diffusive models, to maintain conservation of mass, we must choose a time step based on the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition. Basically, the chosen time step must be sufficiently small so that a given layer will diffuse only to its immediate neighbors. It can be determined using the following equation \\(C=a\\frac{dt}{dz^2}\\), where a is diffusivity, dt time step length, and dz layer depth where \\(C&lt;=1\\). Type 1: Optically Stimulated Luminescence Applications At its most basic, bioturbation is descried be a simple diffusion equation (Johnson et al., 2014; Román‐Sánchez et al., 2019): \\[ \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dz}(D(z)\\frac{dA}{dz})+1 \\] Where a is soil grain age (yr) and D(z) is a biodiffusion function that describes the diffusion-depth relationship. Note, Johnson et al. (2014) and Román‐Sánchez et al. (2019) include a \\(+ 1\\) on the right side of the equation, a term specific to modeling soil grain age. D(z) may be linear, exponential, or constant. Although, as noted above, there is general consensus that this relationship is exponential. Johnson et al. (2014) applies the following two definitions of D(z), the former introduced in Kirkby (1985): \\[ D(z) = D(0)e^{-z/z_{b}} \\] \\[ D(z)=-az+D(0) \\] where zb is a shape parameter [e-folding length scale] and a is the gradient of the slope. A linear model may also be adjusted to represent constant diffusion with depth by setting a equal to zero. [figures here] This model is an oversimplification of a soil-system, however, and surface erosion and deposition are relatively easily introduced. Conceptually, erosion and deposition represent the bulk advective movement of the profile. Erosion movies the profile upwards, and deposition moves the profile downwards. They are introduced to the diffusion-advection equation as T: \\[ \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dz}(D(z)\\frac{dA}{dz})+T\\frac{dA}{dz}+1 \\] Together with the diffusion function, this equation can then be solved analytically, as detailed in Román‐Sánchez et al., (2019), to determine the values of the parameters D(0), zb, and soil depth. T is best determined by other means, like cosmogenic nuclides in Johnson et al. (2014), as current diffusive models introduce too much uncertainty to estimate from age profiles directly (Román‐Sánchez et al., 2019).

It may be worthwhile to consider trying to apply these equations to that data set for extra data. Althought I will need some statistics / “super-computing” practice, as the analytically solutions to these problems are very lengthy.] [(Zhang et al., 2025) uses OSL to date krotovenas, finding they differ significantly from surrounding soil. Also, authors note the presence of a exponential decline in soil depth, likely attributed to bioturbation] [this paragraph needs major work] Using OSL to estimate bioturbation model parameters permits making a few simplifying assumptions, providing an advantage over other methods. One, tracer decay can be neglected. Two, the impact of advective flow via water movement down the profile, besides illuviation of clay minerals, is minimal. It also permits analysis over much greater timescales than surface applied, fallout, and many natural radioisotope tracers allow. However, so far these models are limited to describing local mixing, or the cumulative impact of local and non-local mixing, not being able to represent the different mechanisms by which soil fauna mix soil. With these limitations/simplifications in mind, in the interest of comparison, the above equations can be changed to a more general form: \\[ \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dz}(D(z)\\frac{dyρ}{dz})+\\frac{dz}{dt}\\frac{dyρ}{dz} \\] Where y is the concentration (mass/volume) of some component, ρ is bulk density, and D(z) is a depth-diffusion function. Type 2: Isotope Tracers Jarvis et al. (2010) and Matisoff et al. (2011) apply similar equations derived in Boudreau (1986) for using radioisotope tracers. The following equation is the basic descirption of local mixing. \\[ \\frac{dρy}{dt}=\\frac{d}{dz}(D\\frac{dρy}{dx})-wρy) \\] Where w is rate of downward soil displacement or soil velocity (m/s) (or burial velocity), ρ is bulk density, and D is the biodiffusion coefficient. Note, ρ is included in the derivative to account for varaitions in bulk density along the profile. Type 3: Alternatives [(Sauzet et al., 2023) uses image analysis to estimate an earthworm activity-depth relationship and use that relationship to explain clay redistribution. Their data is fairy different than other authors, although they did not sample the top several cm, where lots of activity takes place. Key Parameters ?? Table Y. Summary of important parameters in animal activity modeling Parameter Description Example Conclusion If you’re a pedologist doing descriptions, leave a column open for animals. Note what organisms are present? How deep do they go? What is the lateral distribution/abundance of krotovinas or tree throw mounds? What structure or texture change might be a product of bioturbation? If you’re designing a study around bioturbation, consider what you are trying to measure. Consider what methods might be most applicable. And consider what kind of shared data is needed to maximize the value of your own.

This data would be fascinating to look more into. Especially if there was invertebrate data to pair it with. As is, this is a good source for the widespread distribution of bioturbators, and shows that at least globally they are sensitive to moisture.

A review of the activities of leaf cutter ants (LCA) in neoamerica. Create both constructional (surface) and excavational (subsurface) landforms that both have impact landscape evolution (e.g. filled burrows contribute to soil creep). They perform both biomixing AND biosorting simultaneously, depending on the parent material. Actions on the landscape are cumulative. Hundreds of colonies over thousands of years. Some intentional constructions: mounds are built to reduce flooding of burrows. Really great figure that represents the different sources of downward-moving material.

Provides a quantitative framework, an equation, to describe the sediment flux by tree throw—based on tree root depth.

Tests the hypothesis that in hillslope w/ bioturbators, gophers, the relationship between diffusivity and curvature is nonlinear. This is true, the relationship is non-linear, because of preferential transport of surface material downhill. Subsurface material movement was found to have no relationship with hillslope gradient. This paper has some excellent statistics too. An example of lateral actions.

A review of the roles or organisms in soil and landscape evolution. AND a review of the 19 landscape evolution models that contain biota parameters—up to 2020. They conclude that this modeling suite is insufficient for biological organisms. Largely because of a lack of data. Role review is mostly focused on hydrology, soil-bedrock production, weathering, and sediment transport. Lacks discussion of the types of animal activities, and their outcomes. This is a great piece of evidence that animal-soil-landscape modes are underrepresented, and that there is a need both for models and a more holistic understanding. Baxter, Timothy, Sam Woor, Martin Coombes, and Heather Viles. “The Geomorphic Work of the European Mole (  Talpa europaea  ): Long‐term Monitoring of Molehills Using Structure‐from‐motion Photogrammetry.” Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, October 13, 2024, esp.6008. https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.6008. Uses image analysis to study molehills dynamics: how they change over time in shape, size, density, etc. Molehills are very dynamic in location, size density, and change in response to season and introduce variability in soils. Clean review data on mole excavation rates but “difficult to compare because of differences in the design (i.e., time and spatial monitoring scale and method), local conditions (i.e., soil type and climate), reported metrics (i.e., volume vs. mass) and research focus of different studies.” Note about the importance of disturbance regime. Moles reconstruct collapsed burrows. If burrows are frequently collapsed (e.g. by floods or human disturbance), moles will anually excavate more sediment than those in stable landscapes. This poses a challenge for measurement, because we then need both mound abundance and disturbance regime. This is a great case study for lateral, random(?) animal activity. Cox, G W, and D W Allen. “Soil Translocation by Pocket Gophers in a Mima Moundfield,” 1987. Study on the horizontal and vertical movement of soil on and surrounding pocket gopher mounds. Results suggests a net movement of soils upwards and mound wards, creating larger and larger mounds. Questions remain: How is this opposed by erosion? Is there an equilibrium rate? This is a great example of topography-behavior connections Darwin, Charles. The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms: With Observations on Their Habits. 1st ed. Cambridge University Press, 1881. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511703850. Obviously, Darwin’s very early work on pedology and bioturbation. He describes how organisms, mostly earthworms, aid in the formation of hillslopes, sort soils and create distinct textural horizons, bury large coarse fragments and ancient buildings, and contribute to the darkening of upper soil horizons. Great paper for the introduction to pedology and bioturbators. Honestly even works as a case study. Don, Johnson. “BIOMANTLE EVOLUTION AND THE REDISTRIBUTION OF EARTH MATERIALS AND ARTIFACTS.” Soil Science 149, no. 2 (February 1990): 84–102. Early biomantle paper.

Grinnell, Joseph. “THE BURROWING RODENTS OF CALIFORNIA AS AGENTS IN SOIL FORMATION.” JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY, 1923. Early work on the impacts of gophers on soil development, somewhat parallel to Darwin’s work on earthworms.

Companion papers with similar content. Authors propose an alternative, processed based model of soil genesis that greatly emphasizes biological processes Introduces the biomantle, the “skin of the earth”, where organisms live, die, and change the soil. Contains a brief history of the other paradigms of soil erosion, dating back to Darwin, Dokuchaev, Hans Jenny, and to more recent USDA scientists. Introduces “bioturbation styles”, great table with upward biotransfers (non-local mixing), biomixing (local mixing), and cratering. Also introduces the dynamic denudation framework, where stonelines develop and serve as permanent restrictive layers in the soil profile. This is a watershed paper in bioturbation literature. Provide several examples of stonelines, Johnson, D. L., and D. Watson-Stegner. “EVOLUTION MODEL OF PEDOGENESIS:” Soil Science 143, no. 5 (May 1987): 349–66. https://doi.org/10.1097/00010694-198705000-00005. Provides a novel framework for soil evolution: one that describe soil as a function of progressive and regressive pedogensis. Progressive pedogensis includes horizonation processes, developmental up-building, and soil deepening. Regressive pedogensis includes haploidization processes, retardant up-building, and soil removal. Development up-building, versus retardant up-building, requires added material be pedogenetically assimilated into the profile. Often this depends on the rate of addition. The authors suggest positive and negative vectors for the following that together drive or oppose soil development. The authors also introduce the idea of internal feedback processes endogenic soil properties dominate over exogenic, environmental factors. For example, a petrocalcic horizon may develop in soil with a Ca rich parent material under an arid climate. This petrocalcic horizon, a product of soil genesis, impacts future development though leaching or bioturbation. A threshold was crossed that put the soil down a unique pedogenetic pathway. The authors also reference Jenny’s 1941 clopt model and use that elegant framework to describe their approach of soil genesis. It is a reminder of the utility of that basic equation and it’s many applications.

Uses quarz grains to date the age of a termite mound and soil beneath. I can see there are no bioturbation rate calculations, although this data could be used. Figure 5 of appendix looks visually very similar to what I modeled. my note: note the shape of C is very similar to what is described by a diffusion-advection model (w/ erosion). 100-150cm is the stoneline layer, the lower boundary of bioturbation, and explains the signifigant increase in age after.

Discusses the genesis of a catena of tropical soils in West Africa making reference to the role of soil fauna, here ants, earthworms, and termites, in the creation of stonelines in soils. The author compares the soil texture of termite mounds to that of the suspected termite-formed horizon and finds them similar. He makes notes about coarse fragment size relating to bedrock fracture density and the releative importance of clay illuviation in texture contrast development.

To this end, the goal primary goal is to create a simple model, with a limited number of input parameters that can… Describe how bioturbation creates texture contrast in soils over time. E.g. stoneline development or clay movement. Describe how erosion rate and particle-size sensitive erosion rate impact texture contrast development. E.g. quantitatively model the dynamic denudation framework of Johnson et al. (2005a and 2005b). Describe how bioturbation drives soil texture variability across a landscape, including sediment supplied to streams. Accommodate changes in erosion and mixing rates at discrete time steps. E.g. to simulate the impact of an invasive species or introduction of bioturbators. Represent a suite of bioturbators with unique particle size preferences and mixing rates and behaviors. 7.1 Soil Transport via Diffusion-Advection The model is based on a layer system to approximate biodiffusion at depth. The number of layers (currently only 5), layer thickness, and profile depth are user-input. At each time step, the soil properties for each layer are calculated based on input parameters and the properties of the layer directly above and below. The model currently assumes steady state conditions: that erosion and soil formation are equivalent, regardless of soil depth, and thus that soil thickness remains constant over time. [citation about steady state] says this is okay… The model is currently integrates local and non-local mixing to simulate two soil properties: one that is included in diffused material (e.g. clay) and one that is excluded from diffused material (e.g. coarse fragments). Figure 1. Visualization of a single layer, i, and the upper and lower layers. The first component is the change in diffusion with depth as a result of decreased in organisms activity as noted by many authors [citation]. Two similar functions are used for this purpose: one for local and one for non-local mixing. Following Johnson et al. (2014), this relationship can be described by: \\[ D(z)=s e^{-z/b} \\] Where D is bulk-soil diffusion (m2/yr), s is the surface diffusion rate (m2/yr), z is depth (m), and b is the e-folding length scale related to organism-dependent bioturbation depth (m) [assumed to be 0.28]. When considering the impact of diffusion on a single soil property, a biodiffusion function can be applied with a concentration value to describe the flux (g/yr) through the profile. Diffusion-advection is a relatively substantial simplification of the bioturbation process where periods of sediment inactivity are interuppted by trans location events. However, prior studies show that the application of a diffusion-advection equation is appropraite if simulation time and the number of translocation events are sufficiently large (Mitchel et al. 2022). Flux between two layers can then be described by: \\[ V_{y, down}=D(z_i)(y_{i-1}-y_i) \\] Where Vy is downward flux across layers (g/yr), i is the current layer, and y is the content of some soil property in the ith layer (g/m2). However, net flux into a layer requires consideration of both upward [i - 1] and downward [i + 1] movement, described by: \\[ V_{y}=D(z_i)(y_{i-1}-y_i) + D(z_i+h_i)(y_{i+1}-y_i) \\] [note: bulk density is implicitly included in the y term, but might not always be] Where hi is the thickness of layer i (m). This is functionally similar to the diffusion-advection equation, \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dz}(D(z)\\frac{dy}{dz})\\), but in a more easily R-model-able format. However, because diffusion will be zero at the top and bottom of the soil profile, a small adjustment is made to eliminate diffusion. This model only considers only local mixing, and does not account for material that is excavated from one layer and deposited on the soil surface. Non-local mixing represents a considerable displacement of material and has considerable impacts on surface material contents (Jarvis et al. 2010; Mastisoff et al. 2011). Including non-local mixing complicates the model and requires more data on the behavior of bioturbators. In comparing models including and excluding non-local mixing, Jarvis et al. 2010 found models without non-local mixing underestimated surface translocation of particles (using 137Cs as tracer). Notably, the authors did not include erosion estimates in their model, which studies show is an important factor in the redistribution of material by bioturbation [citation]. Further study on the importance of modeling non-local mixing is required. [note to self: burial versus erosion rate is a well-studied topic and is worth looking into here] However, a primary interest of our model is the movement of material too large to be mixed by bioturbators, coarse fragments. Coarse fragments are included only in downward local soil movement. They move downwards to infill where material is excavated but are too large to be excavated themselves. Ignoring non-local and upward local mixing, flux of coarse fragments can be simplified to: \\[ V_{S, net}=D(z_i)(S_i) + D(z_i+h)(S_{i+1}-S_i) \\] Where S is the concentration of material of a greater size class than movable by present bioturbators. At the top and bottom of the profile, the above diffusion equations are adjusted to be zero.

At a foundational level, it encompasses aspects of biology, chemistry, and physics. At an earth-system level, it governs the plant’s atmosphere, ecosystems, and water cycle. And at a disciplinary level, it involves agronomists, geologists, geomorphologists, hydrologists, atmospheric scientists, and many, many others. With so much diversity, the knowledge on soil science is vast—which is fitting, as soil is “the most complex and unparsimonious of all natural science entities” (Johnson et al., 2005) and can be studied deeply for great benefit of society. Afterall, soil is everywhere humans are. However, this diversity of work, to be impactful and organized, requires a central guiding principle. It requires an answer to the question: what defines soil? Depending on the author, there are many definitions of soil. A geomorphologist might describe soil based on the nature of weathering and disturbance of the parent material. The Soil Science Society of America defines soil as, “the unconsolidated mineral or organic material on the immediate surface of the Earth that serves as a natural medium for the growth of land plants.” (“What is soil?”). The second edition of the NRCS’s Soil Taxonomy needs three paragraphs to define soil (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). But that is not what defines soil. The question is not how do humans define soil, rather how does nature define a soil. What natural processes or factors create soil? Identifying the processes and factors that define soil is a historied problem and the subject of an entire field, pedology. Now, humans define pedology in a few ways, but Hans Jenny, an influential pedologist, succinctly defines pedology as the “section of the domain of soil science that studies the soil body in its natural position.” (Jenny, 1941). Further, pedology is the study of how soils form and thus provides a foundation from which soil science can grow. It explains that soil is predicable; that its formation is governed by factors and processes that can be quantified; and that climate, topography/relief, organisms, parent material, and time are the key players. This is the big idea I want to talk about—starting from the beginning, with the contributions of four revolutionary soil scientists: Friedrich Albert Fallou, Charles Darwin, Vasily Dokuchaev, and Hans Jenny. C.2 History of Pedology Soils have been important to human society since the beginnings of agriculture. Soils are critical to food production, and much of the field’s practical application lies therein. However, while soil science today is closely associated with agriculture, two of the earliest soil scientists came not from agronomy, but law and biology. In 1862, Friedrich Albert Fallou, a lawyer by training, published his most well-known book titled, “Pedology or General and Special Soil Science” (Fallou, 1862). Fallou’s Pedology is the little-discussed origin of pedology. Fallou was the first to use the term pedology, suggest a new field (kingdom, in his words) of soil science, create a scientifically robust classification system, describe (although in a somewhat limited capacity) the first soil profile, and write early explanations on soil formation (Feller et al., 2022). Fallou’s ideas were novel but of limited scope, comprised of observations made within 25 km2 of his home, and minimally circulated until much later (Feller et al., 2022; Tandarich, 2002). He remains relatively unrecognized, as is true for the next soil scientist, Charles Darwin. Charles Darwin published The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms: With Observations on their Habits in 1881 (vegetable mould being synonymous with soil at the time), and despite being known as Darwin’s ‘worm book,’ the book is mostly about soils (Darwin, 1881). Further, it is important to this discussion because it is one of the first and most complete explanations of the process of soil development. In his book, Darwin describes how organisms, mostly earthworms, aid in the formation of hillslopes, sort soils and create distinct textural horizons, bury large coarse fragments and ancient buildings, and contribute to the darkening of upper soil horizons. Darwin’s ideas on soil formation were early and brilliant and provide a unique, detailed mechanism for the formation of soils. However, for many reasons, Darwin’s ideas on soils would not grip the world as did his work on the theory of evolution, and in 1883, a young Vasily Dokuchaev, the future father of soil science, would publish the landmark book Russian Chernozem that would. Different than Darwin’s worm book, Russian Chernozem provided pedology with A) broader horizons and B) applicability (Dokuchaev, 1883). Chernozem provides great detail on soils across Russia, from its most fertile breadbasket to least fertile lands. It provides evidence from years of observation that climate, parent material, and organisms are responsible for regional difference in soil fertility, and that using these factors, the landscapes can be divided into zones with predictable characteristics. Russian Chernozem was a landmark development in the field of pedology and laid the foundation for the next century of soil science—and soil science application. As an aside, it is difficult to not compare Darwin and Dokuchaev’s contributions and impacts. Both were brilliant soil scientists with revolutionary ideas, so why is Dokuchaev the ‘father of soil science’ and Darwin the ‘worm guy’ or ‘evolution guy?’ Johnson &amp; Schaetzl, 2015 provide a detailed analysis of the two scientists’ approaches and histories, but I instead want to highlight a nexus of society and science. Imagine you are an American Oceanographer in the year 1966, and you have discovered an ancient structure on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. You publish your finding and seek funding for an expensive expedition. You are unsuccessful. Simultaneously, in 1966 the Soviet Union successfully deploys Luna 9, the first unmanned expedition to land on the moon. The competing, expensive American Apollo program has been underway for six years and is just three away from putting three astronauts on the moon. Both advancements push the limits of human knowledge, but one is more socially useful, valuable, and thus visible. The fact that Russian Chernozem was both scientifically revolutionary and practically useful propelled it to the forefront of pedology. Many soil scientists followed Dokuchaev’s framework for soil classification and formation. However, it was in 1941 that Dokuchaev’s ideas were further established when Hans Jenny published his book Factors of Soil Formation A System of Quantitative Pedology (Jenny, 1941). Factors provides a thorough, digestible, but self-reportedly incomplete, theory for the formation of a soil based on a concise few factors. The basic theory: soil is a function of climate, organisms, relief, and parent material over time, is arguably known by every soil scientist or student of soils. \\[ s = f (cl, o, r, p, t, …) \\] Jenny provided a clear, memorable explanation for the formation of any soil based on years of observations across the United States and Europe and rigorous theory and mathematics (Jenny, 1941). The impact of Factors cannot be understated. It is the blueprint for the many editions of Soil Taxonomy (Soil Science Division Staff, 2017), which in turn has been used in creating the maps of the soils of the United States people use every day. Factors provided foundational theory to support practical decisions and was widely circulated. It is the cornerstone of pedology, and its ideas have considerable importance even today. The theories of soil development discussed here have grown over time and today remain strong. The strongest example of this strength comes from the greatest bridge between soil science and society, agriculture, and is known as soil health or soil quality. An early adopter, Dornan and Zeiss define soil health as “the capacity of soil to function as a vital living system, within ecosystem and land-use boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal health” (Dornan and Zeiss, 2000). The term has been on the rise since the early 2000s in the scientific and public lenses (Fig. 2). From a pedological perceptive, soil health implies soil is a dynamic entity: one that can change over time. The word “health” implies that soil can be deemed healthy or unhealthy, and the greatest metric of soil health is organisms, the “o” of “clorpt.” The continued strength of the idea that organisms play a dominant role in changing soils is exemplified in soil health. To conclude, soil science is ever evolving and growing. It encompasses more and more fields, scientists, and professionals every year, and none of that would be possible without the revolutionary foundations laid by scientists throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Fallou, Darwin, Dokuchaev, Jenny, and many others contributed much to the fundamentals of soil science and should be recognized by any soil or environmental scientist. Soils drive and respond to changes in our atmospheric (cl) and land (r, o, p) systems, and we can all benefit from a shared understanding of what we call soil. C.3 References Asio, V. B. (2005).

Accessed 7 Oct. 2024. "],["radionuclide-sampling-protocol.html", "D Radionuclide Sampling Protocol D.1 Background D.2 Protocol", " D Radionuclide Sampling Protocol D.1 Background Measurement of 137Cs and 210Pb inventories is a well-established method of measuring erosion, bioturbation, and sediment transport. They represent a relatively fieldwork-light, although technical, approach to measuring soil erosion across decade to century timescales. The core of the method is comparing 137Cs and/or 210Pb inventories between samples taken at erosional/depositional sites and an undisturbed reference site. Samples with a lesser inventory than the reference site reflect erosion, and cores with a greater inventory reflect deposition. The International Atomic Energy Agency provides general guidelines for 137Cs and 210Pb use in “Guidelines for using fallout radionuclides to assess erosion and effectiveness of soil conservation strategies” 2014. In short, this method involves A) sampling an undisturbed reference site and an erosional/depositional site, B) preprocessing and analyzing samples for 137Cs and 210OPb activity in a lab on a germanium detector, and C) employing a model to convert radioisotope inventories to erosion rates. The application of this method depends on three assumptions on the behavior of these radioisotopes in the environment (IAEA, 2014): 137Cs and 210Pb are spatially uniform across the study area. 137Cs and 210Pb are rapidly and irreversibly absorbed to soil particles, limiting their movement to physical transport. 137Cs and 210Pb depth distributions are equivalent, excluding physical movement of soil particles, between reference and sample sites. However, as many authors explore, these assumptions are imperfect and demand the user consider multiple potential sources of error (Baccolo et al., 2023; Nolin et al., 1993; Parsons &amp; Foster, 2011; Mabit et al., 2013). Following is a discussion of ‘areas of concern’ and how they are addressed in the literature and in review: [Reference site selection] Reference site sampling [Erosion sample position] Erosion site sampling Erosion sample positioning Sample characteristics Bioturbation and nuclide distribution [Reference site selection] Reference site selection can be challenging, especially in study areas with unknown or highly variable land use. The IAEA guidelines provide the following criteria for reference site selection: the site should be 1) undisturbed and under consistent land-use since 1950, 2) within ~1 km of the sample area, and 3) not experiencing erosion or deposition. Hancock et al. 2008, additionally suggests selecting a reference site where precipitation, the driving factor of 137Cs/excess 210Pb deposition (IAEA, 2014), is expected to be similar to the erosional/depositional area. Additionally, if the reference site is in a forest, a larger number of cores should be taken to account for greater heterogeneity (IAEA, 2014). Cores should also be taken avoiding trees and areas of concentrated stemflow (Nolin et al., 1993). D.1.1 Reference site sampling The assumption of an even distribution of fallout across the landscape is limited by several sources of small-scale variability. These include spatial differences in the soil properties that control 137Cs absorption, interception of depositional rainfall by vegetation, uptake of radioisotopes by plants, and animal or human disturbance (IAEA, 2014; Parsons &amp; Foster, 2011; Mabit et al., 2013). To broadly account for this variability, taking replicate cores across the reference site is widely applied. The IAEA guidelines recommend a minimum of 10 - 15 samples per reference site. For a forested site, Nolin et al. 1993 provides equations to estimate the number of samples needed to achieve a specific allowable error and confidence level. However, analyzing 10 – 15 samples can be expensive and time consuming, so many studies bulk reference cores after segmentation to reduce the number of samples to analyze (Arata et al., 2016; Baccolo et al., 2023; Hancock et al., 2008; Nolin et al., 1993). Bulking is also suggested by the IAEA. The downside to bulking samples, however, is the loss of data on the variability of radioisotope inventories across the reference site. Cost, time, and statistical rigor must all be considered when deciding to bulk or not bulk samples. D.1.2 Erosion sample positioning Placement of cores along a hillslope is important to consider before sampling. The IAEA suggests, for a slope with minimal horizontal complexity, a minimum of 3 equally spaced samples along a transect. This is a common approach in the literature, followed by Elliott et al., 1989; Hancock et al., 2008; Nolin et al., 1993; and Wallbrink &amp; Murray, 1996. For more complex slopes, additional cores from additional transects should be taken, but both strategies are compatible with most currently available inventory conversion models (IAEA, 2014). Additionally, there are newer models that allow for greater flexibility in sampling strategy and have demonstrated success under a variety of conditions (Baccolo et al., 2023; Arata et al., 2016). Given relatively equal core spacing along a transect, it also is worth considering what is being measured at each point: e.g. the magnitude of erosion and/or deposition. Elliott et al., 1989, provides a theoretical model for this, depicted below. However, this is dependent on the purpose of the study. D.1.3 Erosion site sampling Accounting for small-scale variability is also important for erosion site sampling, but there is disagreement in the literature about sample numbers. It is relatively common to collect 1 - 5 soil cores at each erosion sampling point (Arata et al., 2016; Baccolo et al., 2023; Hancock et al., 2008; Nolin et al., 1993). This is also in agreement with the IAEA guidelines. However, Parsons &amp; Foster 2011 raises the point that the small-scale variability in 137Cs distribution is not exclusive to the reference site, and that a similar number of replicates, 10 - 15, should be taken from each sampling point. Jarvis et al., 2010 employs this larger number of samples per site, although the focus of that study is not soil erosion. It is worth noting, the above studies with smaller core numbers do present compelling data, and some with comparable measurements by other methods. D.1.4 Sample characteristics Finally, it is important to consider the characteristics of individual cores and samples (cores after bulking or segmenting, final products to be analyzed). For both reference and erosion sites, core depth and radius are important to consider. The IAEA provides guidelines for both. The standard recommendation is a corer diameter of 7 – 10 cm and a total depth of 30cm for reference and erosional sites and 40 – 60 cm for depositional sites. For the most part, this is consistent in the literature (Elliott et al., 1989; Hancock et al., 2008; Nolin et al., 1993; Baccolo et al., 2023; Arata et al., 2016; and Wallbrink &amp; Murray, 1996). However, when many replicates are being taken and bulked, one may consider using a corer of a smaller diameter. Minimizing sample volume makes easier sample processing and more consistent homogenization (Nate Lund, personal observation). In addition, for reference sites, the size of reference core segments is another consideration. Reference cores are segmented for three reasons: (1) to establish the reference inventory, (2) determine the depth profile of 137Cs and 210Pb (necessary for conversion models), and (3) determine the maximum depth of 137Cs and 210Pb activity to inform sampling depth (IAEA, 2014). The IAEA broadly recommends 2 – 5 cm. Smaller segments provide a more detailed activity-depth profile, but require more samples be analyzed. D.1.5 Bioturbation and nuclide distribution Earthworm bioturbation is important factor to consider when converting from radioisotope inventories to erosion and deposition rates. Literature shows that earthworms have a significant impact on the 137Cs distribution in the profile—flattening the exponential decay expected under natural conditions (Jarvis et al., 2010; Tyler et al., 2001; VandenBygaart et al., 1998). VandenBygaart et al., 1998, also suggests a relationship between earthworm abundance and 137Cs redistribution. The consequences of this redistribution are twofold. One, bioturbation by deep-burrowing Lumbricus terrestris may extend the depth of 137Cs distribution beyond 30cm and require deeper sampling. Two, continuous mixing dilutes 137Cs concentration in eroding sediments, which without correction, may result in an underestimation of erosion rates. D.1.6 Radioisotope Sampling Protocol for Jumping Worm Erosion Project D.2 Protocol (Adapted from IAEA guidelines with additions from the literature) 137Cs and 210Pb sampling has two components: establishing the reference inventory and sampling for erosion and deposition along a hillslope transect. In our study, the reference inventory will be established from two sites: one at the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum and another at Lake Rebecca. The reference inventory will be composed of 24 cores taken to a depth of 30 cm and segmented at 5 cm increments. 5 cm segments from all 12 cores will be bulked for a total of 6 reference inventory samples per site: 0-5cm, 5-10cm, 10-15cm, 15-20cm, 20-25cm, and 25-30cm. 7 erosion samples will be taken along a hillslope transect on the summit, shoulder, backslope, footslope and toeslope. Six 30 cm cores will be taken on each contour and bulked in entirety. 264 total cores will be taken for 54 samples to be analyzed on the gamma detector. Following is the sampling strategy model for a single reference and erosion site. D.2.1 Materials Soil corer: ≥30 cm depth, 2.5 cm diameter Sample bags Towel and brush Bucket (optional) Sharpie Ruler (cm) Flags GPS D.2.2 Protocol (adapted from IAEA guidelines) Prior to sampling, either just in the field or using GIS, determine and flag the location of all points you will take cores from. Reference diagram above. Note: Samples should be taken avoiding trees, large roots, downed logs, or any other large disturbance. Label all bags before sampling. Insert the soil corer vertically, not perpendicular to the hillslope, down to 30cm. Pull the corer straight up, and immediately turn the corer sideways to prevent soil from falling out. For very loose or sandy soils, you may need to place a hand at the mouth of the core as it is pulled out. For reference site replicates, either place the core in the gutter to segment, or segment in the corer, whichever is more convenient. If possible, sharpie depth increments onto the corer before you start. Store cores in labeled bags as soon as possible. Using the towel and brush, clean out the corer between samples—especially the mouth of the corer. It is not necessary to clean between sample replicates. But it is necessary to clean between reference replicates. Repeat. [References] Updated 9/18/2024 Arata, L., Meusburger, K., Frenkel, E., A’Campo-Neuen, A., Iurian, A. R., Ketterer, M.
