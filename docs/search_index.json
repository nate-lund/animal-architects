To this end, there are three broad goals: Complete a review of bioturbation rates, frequency, and depth-dependence across organisms. Complete a review of the current bioturbation modeling landscape. Construct a model that integrates bioturbation, erosion, and particle size distribution on soil-profile and landscape scales. 5.2 Goal 1: Bioturbation across organisms 5.3 Goal 2: Bioturbation Modeling Landscape There are a number of bioturbation models already present in the literature 5.4 Goal 3: Modeling Building 5.4.1 Qualitative goals To create a simple model with a limited number of input parameters that can Describe stoneline development and clay homogenization [two of the most important texture parameters] [does advection need to be included for clay?] Describe the relationship between erosion rate and stoneline depth. Describe erosion and deposition as it relates to particle size [to adjust for the preferential erosion of fines] and explain the contribution to streams. Accommodate changes in erosion rates at discrete time steps [e.g. to simulate the impact of an invasive species or landscape change] or in the introduction of bioturbators. Represent a suite of bioturbators with unique particle size preferences [only one per model run though] and mixing rates. Figure 1.
