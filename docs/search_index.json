To this end, there are two broad goals: Complete a review of bioturbation rates, frequency, and depth-dependence across organisms. Complete a review of the current bioturbation modeling landscape. 5.2 Goal 1: Bioturbation across organisms 5.2.1 References Cox, G. W., &amp; Allen, D. W. (n.d.).

To this end, the goal primary goal is to construct a model that integrates bioturbation, erosion, and particle size distribution on soil-profile and landscape scales. More specifically, to create a simple model, with a limited number of input parameters that can Describe how bioturbation creates texture contrast in soils over time. E.g. stoneline development or clay homogenization. [does advection need to be included for clay?] Describe how erosion rate and particle-size sensitive erosion rate impact texture contrast development. E.g. quantitatively model the dynamic denudation framework of Johnson et al. (2005a and 2005b). Describe how bioturbation drives soil texture variabiliy across a landscape, including sediment supplied to streams. Accommodate changes in erosion and mixing rates at discrete time steps. E.g. to simulate the impact of an invasive species or landscape change or in the introduction of bioturbators. Represent a suite of bioturbators with unique particle size preferences and mixing rates and behaviors (only one organism per model run, however). 6.2 Single-profile diffusion Figure 1.
