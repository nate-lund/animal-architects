-   Provides a quantitative framework, an equation, to describe the sediment flux by tree throw—based on tree root depth. Suggest a non-linear relationship between slope angle and sediment flux for creep by tree throw. Relativley independent of curvature.

-   Also, has a small part review of the impacts of various invertebrates (earthworms, ants, termites) and vertebrates (gophers, moles).

-   Tests the hypothesis that in hillslope w/ bioturbators, gophers, the relationship between diffusivity and curvature is nonlinear. This is true, the relationship is non-linear, because of preferential transport of surface material downhill. Subsurface material movement was found to have no relationship with hillslope gradient.

-   This paper has some excellent statistics too.

-   An example of lateral actions.

-   Promotes a conceptual model for describing geomorphic disturbance considering timescale and branching end-state.

-   Mechanisms are described by… frequency, magnitude, duration, areal extent, speed of onset, spatial dispersion, temporal spacing

-   Landscape responses are described by… response (reaction time and relaxation time), resistance (strength or absorption), resilience, and recursion (feedback).

-   This can be used for conceptual model development.

-   A review of the roles or organisms in soil and landscape evolution. AND a review of the 19 landscape evolution models that contain biota parameters—up to 2020. They conclude that this modeling suite is insufficient for biological organisms. Largely because of a lack of data.

-   Role review is mostly focused on hydrology, soil-bedrock production, weathering, and sediment transport. Lacks discussion of the types of animal activities, and their outcomes.

-   This is a great piece of evidence that animal-soil-landscape modes are underrepresented, and that there is a need both for models and a more holistic understanding.

Baxter, Timothy, Sam Woor, Martin Coombes, and Heather Viles. “The Geomorphic Work of the European Mole (  Talpa europaea  ): Long‐term Monitoring of Molehills Using Structure‐from‐motion Photogrammetry.” Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, October 13, 2024, esp.6008. <https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.6008>.

-   Uses image analysis to study molehills dynamics: how they change over time in shape, size, density, etc. Molehills are very dynamic in location, size density, and change in response to season and introduce variability in soils.

-   Clean review data on mole excavation rates but “difficult to compare because of differences in the design (i.e., time and spatial monitoring scale and method), local conditions (i.e., soil type and climate), reported metrics (i.e., volume vs. mass) and research focus of different studies.”

-   Note about the importance of disturbance regime. Moles reconstruct collapsed burrows. If burrows are frequently collapsed (e.g. by floods or human disturbance), moles will anually excavate more sediment than those in stable landscapes. This poses a challenge for measurement, because we then need both mound abundance and disturbance regime.

-   This is a great case study for lateral, random(?) animal activity.

Cox, G W, and D W Allen. “Soil Translocation by Pocket Gophers in a Mima Moundfield,” 1987.

-   Study on the horizontal and vertical movement of soil on and surrounding pocket gopher mounds. Results suggests a net movement of soils upwards and mound wards, creating larger and larger mounds. Questions remain: How is this opposed by erosion? Is there an equilibrium rate?

-   This is a great example of topography-behavior connections

-   Obviously, Darwin’s very early work on pedology and bioturbation. He describes how organisms, mostly earthworms, aid in the formation of hillslopes, sort soils and create distinct textural horizons, bury large coarse fragments and ancient buildings, and contribute to the darkening of upper soil horizons.

-   Great paper for the introduction to pedology and bioturbators. Honestly even works as a case study.

-   Early biomantle paper. Similar but a less fleshed out version of the others from 2005. Great figures for tree throw.

-   This I believe is the earliest mention of the biomantle.

-   Grinnell, Joseph. “THE BURROWING RODENTS OF CALIFORNIA AS AGENTS IN SOIL FORMATION.” JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY, 1923.

-   Early work on the impacts of gophers on soil development, somewhat parallel to Darwin’s work on earthworms. Mentions the role of organism in mixing soil and in doing so enhancing substratum/soil *chemical* weathering.

-   This a good source for early soils-animals work.

-   Hansen, R. M. and Morris M. J. “MOVEMENT OF ROCKS BY NORTHERN POCKET GOPHERS.” Journal of Mammalogy 49 (August, 1968): 391-99.

-   Study on the differences in coarse fragment content (fine, 0.64-1.27, 1.27-2.54, and \>2.54cm) of gopher inhabited topsoil, uninhabited topsoil, summer mounds, and winter casts. Author Suggests gophers cannot move fragments \>5cm, average burrow diameter.

-   This is a great sorting case study / hypothesis.

-   A review of lateral horizon variability. Good figures of tree-throw induced variability.

-   This could be a good lateral variability reference. Need to reed further.

-   Companion papers with similar content. Authors propose an alternative, processed based model of soil genesis that greatly emphasizes biological processes

-   Introduces the biomantle, the "skin of the earth", where organisms live, die, and change the soil. Contains a brief history of the other paradigms of soil erosion, dating back to Darwin, Dokuchaev, Hans Jenny, and to more recent USDA scientists.

-   Introduces “bioturbation styles”, great table with upward biotransfers (non-local mixing), biomixing (local mixing), and cratering.

-   Also introduces the dynamic denudation framework, where stonelines develop and serve as permanent restrictive layers in the soil profile.

-   This is a watershed paper in bioturbation literature. Provide several examples of stonelines,

-   Provides a novel framework for soil evolution: one that describe soil as a function of progressive and regressive pedogensis. Progressive pedogensis includes horizonation processes, developmental up-building, and soil deepening. Regressive pedogensis includes haploidization processes, retardant up-building, and soil removal. Development up-building, versus retardant up-building, requires added material be pedogenetically assimilated into the profile. Often this depends on the rate of addition. The authors suggest positive and negative vectors for the following that together drive or oppose soil development.

-   The authors also introduce the idea of internal feedback processes endogenic soil properties dominate over exogenic, environmental factors. For example, a petrocalcic horizon may develop in soil with a Ca rich parent material under an arid climate. This petrocalcic horizon, a product of soil genesis, impacts future development though leaching or bioturbation. A threshold was crossed that put the soil down a unique pedogenetic pathway.

-   The authors also reference Jenny's 1941 clopt model and use that elegant framework to describe their approach of soil genesis. It is a reminder of the utility of that basic equation and it's many applications.

-   Uses quarz grains to date the age of a termite mound and soil beneath. I can see there are no bioturbation rate calculations, although this data could be used.

-   Figure 5 of appendix looks visually very similar to what I modeled. my note: note the shape of C is very similar to what is described by a diffusion-advection model (w/ erosion). 100-150cm is the stoneline layer, the lower boundary of bioturbation, and explains the signifigant increase in age after.

-   Sorting case study too

-   A dated study on a number of topics, with valuable information on burrow depth and a decent dataset of soil displacement rates by different gopher species.

-   Great figure on burrow area w/ depth.

Discusses the genesis of a catena of tropical soils in West Africa making reference to the role of soil fauna, here ants, earthworms, and termites, in the creation of stonelines in soils. The author compares the soil texture of termite mounds to that of the suspected termite-formed horizon and finds them similar. He makes notes about coarse fragment size relating to bedrock fracture density and the releative importance of clay illuviation in texture contrast development.

-   This is a good case study for animal sorting.
