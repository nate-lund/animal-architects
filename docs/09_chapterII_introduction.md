# Introduction



Provide a background and on role of animals in soil development. Introduce some of the important figures in pedology that discussed animal activity: Fallou, Darwin, Dokucahev, Jenny [LAAS 5050 paper can be used here], to establish importance....

A word on nomenclature. Soil or soil-adjacent scientists use many terms to describe the role living organisms play in a soil system. Broadly pedoturbation, bioturbation, fauna-/floraturbation, or biomixing (Wilkenson et al., 2009), or more specifically mounding, cratering, or burrowing (Johnson et al., 2005a), to name a few. For this discussion, I suggest a more generalized term: animal activity. The term animal activity has the advantage of being implicity process-based. I.e. animal activities are distinct from the evidence of animal activities. It also encourages thinking about the animals themselves and their relationships to each other and their environment. And finally, it suggests a degree of unintentionality. Animals, oftentimes including humans, have no understanding of soils or soil science. All the evidences we study are the unintentional consequences of their lifestyles, often over generations.

There exist already a number of excellent reviews on the various roles and categorizations' of animal activity in soil development (Bétard, 2021; Gabet et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2005b, 2005a; Johnson & Watson-Stegner, 1987; Wilkinson et al., 2009). So, although we discuss these important topics, this paper's emphasis will be on the quantification of these categories and how they can be integrated in a holistic, qualitative framework for describing soil fauna activities. Of particular interest is the methods of measuring animal activity. One of the goals of this paper is to take a first, albeit small, step towards creating a standardized, discipline-wide understanding of how and why animal activity is measured.

-   Geomorphology

-   Hydrology (infiltration)

-   Soil carbon

-   Weathering

-   Soil health - seen a paralell rise with the renewed interest in the role of organisms in soil development. "From a pedological perceptive, soil health implies soil is a dynamic entity: one that can change over time. The word “health” implies that soil can be deemed healthy or unhealthy, and the greatest metric of soil health is organisms, the “o” of “clorpt.” The continued strength of the idea that organisms play a dominant role in soil systems is exemplified in soil health. (LAAS 5050)"

This review is broken into two halves: one focused on concepts and methods and the other on numerical modeling. Both are equally important, and there is signifigant connective tissue between them.
